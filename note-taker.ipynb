       "1. Confirmation Bias:\n",
       "- The tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs.\n",
       "- People tend to ignore or dismiss information that challenges their existing views.\n",

       "- The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making a decision.\n",

       "- Example: Pricing an item higher than its actual value to make a later price seem like a better deal.\n",

       "3. Availability Bias:\n",
       "- The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events based on their availability in memory.\n",
       "- People rely on immediate examples that come to mind rather than considering complete data or statistical probabilities.\n",
       "- Example: Someone might assume that plane crashes are more frequent than car accidents because news headlines about plane crashes tend to be more attention-grabbing.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Confirmation Bias:\n",
       "- The tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms one's existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.\n",
       "- This bias can lead to a reinforcement of preexisting beliefs and hinder openness to alternative perspectives or information.\n",
       "- Example: A person who strongly believes in a particular political ideology may only consume media that aligns with their beliefs, thus reinforcing their views.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Overconfidence Bias:\n",
       "- The tendency to overestimate one's abilities, knowledge, or wisdom.\n",
       "- People often have an unwarranted confidence in their judgments or predictions.\n",
       "- Example: A student may perceive themselves as better prepared for an exam than they actually are, leading to poor performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Confirmation Bias:\n",
       "- The tendency to interpret or remember information in a way that confirms our existing beliefs or theories.\n",
       "- This can lead to selective perception and memory distortion.\n",
       "- Example: A person who values punctuality may perceive others as being late more often than they actually are.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Halo Effect:\n",
       "- The tendency to generalize a positive impression of someone or something based on one specific characteristic or trait.\n",
       "- This can lead to biased judgments and assumptions about unrelated attributes.\n",
       "- Example: Assuming that a physically attractive person must also be intelligent and kind.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Hindsight Bias:\n",
       "- The tendency to see past events as more predictable than they actually were.\n",
       "- This bias can lead to an overestimation of one's ability to predict future events and an underestimation of luck or chance.\n",
